# 🏥 Max Life Health Insurance - Cross Sell Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will opt for cross-selling of health insurance, based on their demographic and behavioral data. It's a classification problem solved using multiple machine learning algorithms.

## 📌 Objective
To build a machine learning model that can classify potential customers who are likely to buy additional health insurance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Understanding**
   - Explored customer demographics, vehicle, and driving experience.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and encoding of categorical features.
   - Feature scaling for numerical variables.

3. **Model Building**
   - Tried models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
   - Hyperparameter tuning for performance improvement.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC
   - Confusion Matrix for class-wise performance
